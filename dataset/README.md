### How to classify PF and NPF reads
From the FASTQ files provided by Illumina sequencing, the cluster coordinates of PF reads are identified, and by matching them with coordinates in the locs file, the cluster numbers of PF reads can be determined.  
Then, the cluster numbers of NPF reads are identified using the filter file.  

### Cluster numbers of reads (./ncl/)
Using the above method, it is possible to distinguish PF and NPF reads.  
But, we provide the cluster numbers for PF and NPF reads for your convenience.
